This is a PDF CHATBOT made with Python. My latest Machine learning/AI project allows anyone to upload PDF file(s) and begin to interract with the chabot about the content of the PDF(s). This chatbot takes multiple PDF uploads and the model will be able to read through.

UseCase:
This saves ton of time to have to go through PDF documents. All you have to do is to upload all your PDF documents and the model reads through and then you can begin to start a conversation similar to this with the chatbot;

User: What is the document all about?,
Bot: The document talks about ...,
User: Can you find the page that talks about approval?,
Bot: Page 4 line 2 discusses...
